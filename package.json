I did my bachelorâ€™s in computer science and I learned java, c language, programming skills, database, and many other subjects which was very interesting. And now I am currently pursuing masters in suny new paltz. In my leisure time I usually like to watch tv, reading books, playing games, surfing internet. One of the funniest parts about me is that i love travelling a lot. My favourite website is amazon, and Netflix.",
