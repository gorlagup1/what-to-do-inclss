            <h3> Please do not view the source. That would defeat the point</h3>
            <p style="background-color:light blue;">

                Please try to recreate this set of menus, or a similar looking set of menus. Do not google how to do it. Just try to do it on your own with the knowledge that you already have. If you have a hard time recreating this with only html & css (no js). Then please continue to learn and practice CSS for a few hours every day until you become proficient. </p>
